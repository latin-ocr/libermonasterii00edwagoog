him, he may also have leavened it with some members
of his own choice. Among the facts here recorded, and
not (asI believe) to be found in other chronicles os English
origin, not the least interesting is the chronicler’s ex-
press statemont (p. 206) that Gund1·ada,wife of Wil-
liam, first carl of Warren and Surrey, was the sister
of Gherbod or Gorb0d0, “the Fleming,'' (first earl of
Chester aiter the Conquest) and therefore not the
daughter of the Conquerar, but of his queen, Matilda,
by a former marriage. The popular story—which has
so alten led to the insertion of Gundrada's name in
books, and in pedigrees, to which it is wholly foreign-
never had an hictmdccl foundation, and it probably
owes much more of its vitality to Sir William Bur-
rell’s conspicuous inscription, of 1775, iu Seuthover
Chmch, than to either the misapprehension of the phrase
stirps clocam, on the ancient slah of St. Pancras' Priory,
or to Sandford's hasty assumption, in the scell-known
book whence recent writers have drawn their informa-
tiou. To 111. Thomas Stapleton belongs the credit of
having shown, long ago, before the Archaeological In-
stituta the extreme tenuity of the foundation on which
so considerable a superstructurc had been built up ¹;
although neither he nor (I believe) any other writer
has noticed the passage now published. But cogent
as are Mr. Stapleton's argrnnents, from other evidence,
the common story has had nearly the same currency,
since their appearance, as before.

One other small point of archaeological curiosity may
claim an additional word or two. When the remarks
as to the long interval that elapsed between Grimbald’s
arrival in England, and the first step towards the actual
foundation of the New Minstcr, were made (p. xxv. above),
it had escaped notice that several entries exist in the
