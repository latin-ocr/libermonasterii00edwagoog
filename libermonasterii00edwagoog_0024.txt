even ae respects that portion3 and is extremely confused
in its arrangement and sequence—partly from oversights
in the transcription itseif, partly l’rom the subsequent
misbinding. This MS. contains no indication of Stow's
opinion either es to the author or the date of hie origi-
nal. Buten the recto of the forty-seventh written lead
Stow has subjoined the following note :—

“ Mensorcndwm thot tlecre bc in tte Booke of
“ Hyde, ἀπ preci ond large parchment acribo,
“ dynore estha tlee‘aye before writes, ond crouy
“ other Testamenta of ortega Sason tinge, which
“ he unitus in bastard Somou, und translated into
“ Lotyn ond Eoylyeelsc.”

Construed strictly, the expression “dyvars of the
“ things ’' would, of course, imply that there are, in the
Lausdowne Ms, other⁴ extracts than those from the
Book of Hyde, but the fact is not so. Prior to the
acquisition of this MS. by Lord Lansdowne it belonged
to Sir Henry St. George, in whose possession it was in
t11eyear1697.¹ ’

In the sixth volume, it may be added, of Stow's
manuscript “Historical Collections‚”-also preserved in
the British Museum, but amonget the Harleian MSS.
(No. 542, p. 123,)-he speaks again of Liber de Hyde
in these termsz—

“Annales Menanterii de Hyde e'e ore abnegent
“ booles, mnteynynge the oryyyaolls and encreoee
“ of ttae hewse, wa the notoblc ttynye thot toprsed
