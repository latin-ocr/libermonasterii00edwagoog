Quolmipm· Nicholas Harpeseldf ιιι his Hietorw Aoplieaoo Ec·
H„ meto· tration print tcd ιιι Douays m lom, had made several,
ΗΜ arpo· but lese extensive quotatieno from the Book os moe,
iiia, prior to those both οι Spelmon aad ampullaceo
ιιιι MS sometimes ιιι Αιιιιιιιιι Novi ίίιιιιοιιιί Wintooi·

ειιιιιι, ”and sometimes simply as Αιιιιιιιιιι wivilonem!

But, like Spelrnan and like Λιιοιιι, he gives no indica·

tion of ἱιιι ιιιοιιι abode. N οι can any entry οι it be found

io the C( ιιι dopue ιιιιιιιιιισι iptorum duplic et Hihcrnioe.

ino ιι Finnlly on this head, it may deserve notice that Hugh

μὲι ‚⁸¹¹⁶ le Creesy ιιι his Olmreh uestem os Brattia J speaking
of (l rimbald'e oret ion at the Council of London, m 886,

writes thim: “ If the reader have the curiosity to

“ pemse the whole oration, he must have reeourse ιο

“ the fore-mentioned Λιιιιιιιι os ll'inchealer or the hook

“ called Liber de Ιιιιιιι, where it hath been preserved

¹‘ in a grateful memory of St. (tentalum l doubt,

however, if Creoy had seen the hs, he cites. hluch οι

hie hook is a compilation and translation from alsord

(who has been largcly laid under contribution hy other

writers than Cresey, both of earlier and οι later date).
Cressy’o work was eompleted in France, if not wholly
compiled there. and there is reason to think that his
knowledge of Liber de deo, ae of other English MSS

quoted in the t'hureh Hietorp of nriuaoy, wrm derived

ιιι second hand. The hooko both οι Harpefeld and

hlford were, indeed-like Creavy'o—printed on the
continent But llnrpsfeld wasa Wykchamist. Both

he and Αιιοιιι had spent many studione years in English
manoe-homes and librarieS. t'resey'a work appeared in

1669, ιιιιιι is the latest hook in which I have oleerved

quominus from [siler de Hydo- in ito anthentie ιιιιιιι.
