INTRODUOTION. ' xxv

Why au interval of more than fifteen years should
have clapsed between this arrival and Alfred's death,
aad yet scarcely the first steps have been taken tc-
wards the accomplishment of the main object for which
Grimbald was avowadly invited, there is nothing in the
Book of Hyde to explain

If, in this point of view, the statements in the contro-
verted and famous passage of the Annals cf Alfred by
asser, which first appeared in Oamdcn's edition, be col-
lated with the account of Grimbald, given in the present
volume, the difficulty is rather increased than lessencd.
Grimbald's removal from Oxford to Winchesteris there
dsoed in the third year alter his arrival in England, and
it is asserted that he established himself “ in the Ncw
“ Monastery which Alfred had erected.” If the earlier
portion of this statement-whatever its authorship-be
in substance authentia, Grimbcld's labours at Oxsord
will in nowise account for the dslay cf the enterprise at
winchester.

A passage in Malmesbury seems, on the other hand,
to suggest the possibility that Alfred may have esta-
blished Grimbald as the head of some temporary religious
community, as a preliminary step towards the foundation
of the intended monastery. But this supposition derives
nc support from the Book cs Hyde. In the majority of
extant MSS. of Malmesbury’s History hc merely anti·
cipatas the error of the minor annalist of Winchsster by
saying cf Alfred: “Monasteria ubi opportunum vide·
“ bat muesz-unum in Adelingia ..... alarum
“ c'a Wcuoaia, quod dicitur Novum Mcnasterium, ubi
“ Grimbaldsusra abbatem wmtttuit.''¹ Oertain other

MSS, however, cf Malmesbury,—those, hemely, which ’
