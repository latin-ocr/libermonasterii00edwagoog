Ostha aoth of J anuary 1857, the Master of the Rolls
submitted to the Treasurya proposal for the publication
of materiale for the History of this Country from the
Invasion of the Romans to the Reign of Henry VIII.

'Phe Master of the Rolls suggested that these materiale
should be selected for publication under competent
editors without reference to periodical or chronological

arrangement, without mutilation or abridgment, prefer·
ence being given, in the first instance, to such materials
as were most scarce and valuable.

He proposed that each chronicle or historical docu-
ment to be edJ'ted should be treated in tho same way as
if the editor were engaged on an Editio Princeps3 and
for this purpose the most correct text should be formed
from an accurate oollation of the best MSS.

To render the work more generally useful, the Master
of the Rolls suggested that the editor should give an
account of the MSS. employed by him, of their age and
their peculiarities ; that he should add to the work a
brief account of the life and times of tho author, and any
remarks necessary to explain the chronology3 but no
other note or comment was to be allowed, except what
might bo necessary to establish the correctness of the

text.
