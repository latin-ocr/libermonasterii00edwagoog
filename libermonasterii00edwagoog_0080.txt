Andrew Davidem, and John Denning (probably ser·
vants 01 the abbey)‚ had twenty-six abillings and
eightpence a piece yearly. It appears from the recorda
of the Court 01 Augmentations that most of the minor
annnitants were still in receipt 01 their respective
annuities in 31d Philip and Mary‚ 1557-8, bnt only
ten of the monks were then pensionem, besides the
prior. To Wriothesley, Henry granted several 01 the
richest of the mauors of Hyde Abbey‚ including those
of Micheldever and Stratton‚ in Hampshire. He had
also a lease of the entire site of the abbey‚ its
church and appurtenances. This lease was for a short
term and a specific purpose.¹ Wriothesley pulled the
abboy down with amazing expedition, and sold the
rich materiola That done, the reversion of the site
passed, together with the demesne lands of the abbey,
by royal grant to Richard Bethell. Wriothesley became
eventnally Baron Wriothesley and chancellor of England
(1544), and earl of Southampton (1547). On receiving
the great seal he took an oath 01 abjuration, which
began by stating that he had “now the vail 01 darkness
“ of the usnrped jurisdiction of the 000 and hishop of
“ Romo clearly taken away from his eyes.'’2

bered aa the friend of Shalrespeare‚—forfeited them,
with his other possessione, by the results 01 his chi-
valric affection for Robert Devereux, second earl of
Essex, bnt recovered them by the favour 01 dames
the First. Just before bis forfaiture, the earl was
engaged in a snit in Chonnery against Thomas Petre
and another, respecting the extent of the manor 01
