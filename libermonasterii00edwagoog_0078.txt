The chief acting commissioner on this occasion was
Abbot Salcot's “ friend, Master Thomas Wrythysley,''
who adds this postscript on his own account: “I
“ beseech your good lordship to pardon the rudeness of
“ this letter, written in haste in the church, when I
“ was wenry.'' To what degree Wriothesley lay open
to the charge of “coming for the treasure,'' few words
are needful to show. A word or two may also be ap-
propriate concerning the man himself.

Thomas Wriothesley's grandfather was “Garter” to
Edward the Fourth. His father was “ Norroy'’ to
Henry the Seventh Thomas himself began his studies
in the Herald's Collega but at an early age exohanged
that seat of learning for an lnn of Oourt. Three
years before this visit to Hyde Abbey, Lord Chan-
cellor Audley had given him an office in the Court
of Common Pleas, and bad brought him under the
notice of the King. He had had the good fortune,
as it turned out, ιο strive (although vainly) to dissuade
Henry from marrying Anne of Oleves. Wriothesley
had seen the lady. Hsnry had seen but her portrait.
When the princess reached Whitehall, the king, it is
said, felt a rueful sort of gratitude to the disregarded
edviser. Thenceforth, Wriothesley's scot was securely
planted on the ladder of court preferment.
