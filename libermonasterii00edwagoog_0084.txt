When the excavations which were made for the Bride-
well and its adjuncta reached the several points marked
a and b h b, many stone coffins were found ; the bones The dese
which they contained were tossed about, and some of {mm
the coffins were broken to pieoes. Others were turned
into water-troughs. Many patens, chalican, and rings
were also found. Dr. Milner notioes that Roman urns
(of which the monks could have had neither know-
ledge nor suspicion) were also disinterred at no great
distance from the spot marked α. Ifour rudediagram be ¹
looked at, it will be seen that, from the general eontour
of the clay-covered spaced d d d, which indicates the
site of the greca church of Hyde, the spot marked o

. occupies the position where the high altar might be
looked for. It was here that various fragments of
marhle columns were discovered. At the point marked
o three coffins, and no more, were found. These must
have been buried immediately in front of the high altar,
and they were of a markedly superior kind to the othere.
It ean only be matter of conjecture that these were the
coffins of Alsred, of Ealswyth‚ and of Edward the Elder3
but the conjecture has every fair presumption of proba-
bility in its favour. The decayed lead of the priucipal
coffin, found at a, was sold as old metol for two guineas.l
Thac thus much is known in detail of the scandal of
1788 is due partly to Dr. Milner, but mainly to a
gentleman of Oumberland, Mr. Henry Howard‚ of Corby,
whose regimeut happened to be quartered at Wiuchester,
several years afterwards. His eager researches made
him acquainted with the superintendent of the labourers,
and so enabled him to familiarize himself with every
part of the ground, and to hear of each step of the
desecration from eyewitnesses. He also obtained a slab
which bears Alfred's name, but this is not—as has been

asserted-any portion of the tomb. It was, in all proba-
