attendanoe οἷ’ tho abbot, with ten monks at least in
his train, was to be deemed a sufficient mark of reve-
renda This little squabble was 'settled more quietly
than some nearly contemporary differences between the
same bishop and his own society at St. Swithun’s‚
where the monhs testified at onoe their anger and their
perplexity, by assembling barefoot, and with crucifixos
turned upside down, and then marching in strange pro-
oession, “contrary to the course of the sun, and the

‘¹ depriving his monks of their dues, they too would
‘⁴ serve the Church in controverted formo,’' by way of
visible protest against him.¹ These, however, ara but
lovers' quarrels, when compared with the long and fieroe
send between the monks of Hyde, during six years of
it without their head, and Giffard's ambitious and tur-
bulent suceessor, Hemy of Blois, abbot of Glastonbury,
and brother of King Stephon,2 who had been conse·
mad in the autumn of 1129, and whose praises ns an
exemplary bishop have been sung by other monks, who
had the good fortune not to incur his frown.

1761), dismisses the long quarrel with Henry of Bl⁰i³ll⁰ynddhb
in these brief words: “The ohuroh was vacant sixberbr
