The works to ba published in octavo, separately‚ as
they were finished3 the whole responsibility of the task
resting upon the editors, who were to be chosen by the
Master ol the Rolls with the sanction of the lreasury.

The Iords of Her Majesty's lheasmy, astera carehrl
consideration of the subject, expressod their opinion in a
Treasruy Minute, dated February 9, 1857, that the plan
recommended by the Mastor of the Rolls “was well
calculated sor the accomplishment ol this important
national object, in an effectual and satisfactory manner,
within a reasonable time, and provided proper attention
be paid to eeonomy, in making the detailed arrange·
ments, without unneeessary expense.’'

'lhey expressod their approbation of the propesal that
each chronicle and historicnl document should be edited
iu such a manner as to represent with all possible eor·
reetness the text ol· each writer, derived from a collation
ol the best MSS, aad that no notes should be added,
except such as were illustrative ol the various readings.
They suggested, however, that the prelaee to each work
should contain, in addition to the particulare proposed
by the Master of the Rolls, a biographical account oi
the author, so sar as authentie materials existed for that
purpose, and an estimato of his lustorieal credibility and
value.
