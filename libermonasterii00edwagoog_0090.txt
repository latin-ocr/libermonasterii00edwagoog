fellows struggled long, aud humbly represented to the Elisabeth
Quoen tho obligations of their oaths of offioe. But in
1579 Wulsynghom wrote to the werden, in very plain
terme, that it was becoming imprudent in the College
“to excite Her Mujesty’s displeasure ” by so long de
luying to grant a lesse of Piddletrenthide to ΜΓ. Georgo
Goring (of the well known Sussex family). If, he says,

Encouroged by so good en example, Sir Robert Ceoil‚
at a subsequent period, forced the worden und fellows
to give him a boud, in the sum of eight hundred pounds,
not to grant any lease of certain other College lands,
seve to him or with his consent. And, eventually,
they were compelled to make a reversionary lesse of
those lands to the Queen herself.³ For whose benefit
is uncertain.
