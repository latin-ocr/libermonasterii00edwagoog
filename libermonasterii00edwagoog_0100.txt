Miscellany is occupied with the services appropriated
to many of tha great fasts and festivals of the Ohurch,
and to various forms of blessing. On fol. 89 occurs a

day, with the primitive musical notes used by the Anglo

Saron Ohurch. Another liat of monks-in more hands
than one—ensues on ff. 98 and 99; followed (ff. 100,

ster, partly in Anglo-Saxon: with a Calendar of Saints
(fol101); another charter relating 00 Alton (001. 107);
together with prayers, creeds, and other fragments
partly in Saron (ff. 108-111). Το0 book concludes
