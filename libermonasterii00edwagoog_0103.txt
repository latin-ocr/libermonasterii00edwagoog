But it would be far more easy to tabulate these ‹lis-
crepaneies than to suggest any satisfactory explanation
os them.

Oi the extreme confusiones chronology resulting from
the practice os car-class alnidyrncnt, a conspicuous, but iar
from singular, instance may be seen at page 167,οὴοω
the Chronicler makes a paragraph respecting tbe undated
birth oi two sons, or putative sons, of King Cnut, by
Eligifu, ‹laughter oi Elihelm (not described as being

was obviously before him, buthe transposed his original

The fragmentary Chronicle which forms appendix Α
(and is printed from the Cotton ΜΒ. Domitian, A. xiv.)
contains several glaring chronological erreis, which have
come simply from a tmnsposition oi numerals, and there·
