Tbelryos The Book of Hyde is not only a Chronicle, but a
cmm Chartulary. Each of the regnal chronicles of Alfred,
of Edward the Elder, of hthelstan, of Edrcd‚ of Edwy,
of Edgar, and of Ethelred, bas an appendix, containing
charters, willa, and other documenta relating, more. or
less ‹lirectly‚ to tbe endowmente, privileges, and history
of tho community of Hyde. Many of these ‹locuments
are exhibited in three lunguages,—as will have been seen
already, by the quotation from Stow,—namely, in Angla-
Saxon (often in every corrupt form), in Middlo English,
and in Latin. Some os thern are known hy other copies
contained in MSS. belonging to the Cotton and Harleian
Collections, or to tbat of tbe Eorl of Ashburnharn. Of

others, the originale still exist amongst tbe munimenta of
Winchester Collega, and these-which had never before

been examined-l have, through the kindness of the
Wardcn of that noble foundation (whose rare fortune
it was to escape the mcehes of tbc great spoliator of
collegas as well as of abbeys), bad the. satisfaction to
collate for this volume. Others, again, are found only
in the Book of Hyde. Both tbe text and the trans-
lations of Anglo·Saron documenta sometimes evinec an
exeeedingly imperfect knowledge of tbat language, bat
thcy nre neverthcless of great philological curiosity arrd
interest. Of King hifred's will no medimval copy was
herctoforc known, save thet in Lord Ashbnrnbcm's
hlisoellnny volume, usirally quoted aa “Stowe MS, lll.
